This is actually our second attempt in recording this episode, the previous attempt may be released as a blooper and will have its own educational value.  
In this episode we discuss the following:  
  a) Oil in everyday life, it's use over the years.  
  b) Different qualities of oil found around the world.  
  c) Global oil prices and driving forces.  
  d) Trading oil futures.    
  e) Oil production - OPEC countries vs the US.  
  f) Shale vs conventional oil.  
  f) Demand trends.
Given how much of an impact oil has in the realm of business and politics, it will be unfair to compress everything about it in a 50 minute discussion.
Hence, we will continue discussing oil in the next episode. More precisely, we will discuss the following:
a) What would the world look like, if oil wasn't discovered?
b) The future of the world with or without oil?

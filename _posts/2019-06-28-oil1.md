This is actually our second attempt at recording this episode. The previous attempt may be released as a blooper and will have its own educational value.  
In this episode of The Next Big Thing, we discuss the following:  
  a) Oil in everyday life, it's use over the years.  
  b) Different qualities of oil found around the world.  
  c) Global oil prices and driving forces.  
  d) Trading oil futures.    
  e) Oil production - OPEC countries vs the US.  
  f) Shale vs conventional oil.  
  f) Demand trends.  
Given the impact of oil in the realm of business and politics, it will be unfair to compress everything about it in a 50 minute discussion.

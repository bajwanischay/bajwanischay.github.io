If you still have your doubts about pressing play, here's why and how I went about this new endeavor.

# Why?
I believe in conversations. I have spent the last four years living with the some of the smartest people I know. The ideas I gathered from these people have been subconsciously shaping my own views on certain subjects. Most of these ideas were discussed and debated during the long and interesting conversations we had in the corridors of BITS Pilani.   
After graduating, I have had the opportunity to work with exceptionally smart people. It has been a pleasure discussing the same ideas with these people coming from all around the world and examining their viewpoint on issues that concern us all as humans.
The fact that most of my ideas have been shaped by conversations with intelligent people came as an epiphanic realization. I began to start valuing conversations. I started participating in them more often, with an intent to learn. 

After one such long conversation, I felt that there is value in putting these conversations on record.   
At first, I decided to blog about what I learned through these conversations. If you have ever been a witness to my literary masterpieces, you know about my strained relationship with wo. Keeping this in mind, I decided to channel these conversations into a format more suitable to candid verbal expression- A podcast.  
A podcast would get more people involved in these discussions as listeners. These people would help us refine our opinions with their feedback. Further, recorded conversations would also help us to get back to them in retrospect and realize how our opinions have changed as they inevitably will.  
 
So, with half the inspiration required for starting this podcast I decided to find the other half. I needed a co-host and decided to bug the only podcast junkie I knew- Abhinav Palaparthy. 

As it turns out, this was all the convincing he needed.

# How?
## The structure
Over the planning and deliberation that went on for the next few days, we decided to keep our discussions limited to the broad topics of global business and politics. We also decided to record on a bi-weekly basis. This would discipline us to read and learn about a new subject every fortnight thus keeping our post-college learning curve a steep as possible. For every subject, we would invite a guest speaker if we know someone who can add value to the conversation.  
Most importantly, we decided to do everything with the sole intent of educating ourselves.

## The logistics
As beginners, we decided to resort to humble logistics 
The podcast would be recorded on a skype call and with not more than 4 people in a conversation. It would be released on all major streaming platforms.

## The name
After deliberating titles for about five minutes, it gave us immense comfort to resort to the most cliched name we could think of.

## First Episode
Next weekend, we decided to record our first episode, which shall remain unaired for the common good of mankind. The podcast starts with our second episode- Modinomics.
